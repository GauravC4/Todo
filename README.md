# Todo
A todo list application as every beginner does.
You can add , delete and mark item as completed, filter on completion status.

Event though i am not a beginner, i started web dev using frameworks.
This is my first project which uses bare bones HTML, CSS, JS ... no libs or frameworks.
I have done this as first project in Creative JS Course by DevEd.
